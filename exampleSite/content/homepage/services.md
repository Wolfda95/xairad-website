We conduct research at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Medical Imaging, with key focus areas including:
- Explainable AI
- Self-Supervised Pre-Training
- Vision-Language Models and Multimodal Large Language Models
- Radiomics

Our work spans a range of medical imaging modalities, such as:
- CT
- MRI
- PET/CT and PET/MRI

We develop AI solutions for tasks including:
- Classification
- Segmentation
- Visual Question Answering

Our vision is to advance medical imaging and diagnostics by developing, analyzing, and refining AI methods. We aim to make these technologies transparent, robust, and clinically meaningful while critically evaluating their risks and limitations to ensure safe integration into medical practice.
